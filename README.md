Coming soon to a theatre near you...

Will: color, projectiles

Kevin: objectives, particles, life stuff

Adi: walls, GUI

Other: health?




## Key features
(To mention in writeup?)

1. Camera Swapping
    We can swap from a 2d to 3d camera, and we now have orbit controls
    (locked to a cone above the player)
2. Bounding box camera chasing
    When the player moves too far from the center of the screen, the
    camera chases them at a distance
3. Color modulations
    Selectively quantize colors in certain channels to certain color bit depths
4. optimized collision detection
      Consider collisions with large bounding boxes containing many objects to
      immediately exclude objects that cannot possibly collide.
5. Projectiles + Particles
